Mini-Challenge 3 - Top 10s  -->
We both made a webpage of our Top 10 Favorite Movies 
Peer Reviewed by Tony Fernandez & Alejandro De La Cruz-Rubio
Comments - I very much enjoyed the the home page layout, the quotes was a very nice touch. The color selection for the background of the webpages was a good pick and compliments the movie posters. Project worked perfectly, also enjoyed the "trailer" buttons.
