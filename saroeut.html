          <p class="card-text">One of my favorite comedies of all time, I feel like this movie is the most realistic portrayal of how it was it was like to actually to be teenager in high school. It tells the story of two inseparable best friends as they navigate the last weeks of high school and are invited to a gigantic house party. Together with their nerdy friend, they spend a long day trying to score enough alcohol to supply the party and inebriate two girls in order to kick-start their sex lives before they go off to college. The acting was great and the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Micheal Cera are unmatched, if you're looking to laugh nonstop, I highly reccommend this movie. </p>

      <p class="card-text">I have a lot of love and admiration for Christopher Nolan as has made some of my favorite movies and this by far my favorite. In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand, a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper, and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home. I love the idea of space travel and black holes and anything involving life outside our own and movie had it all. Music is also something I consider very vital in a movie and this movie has a phenomenal soundtrack, shout out Hans Zimmer.</p>

      <p class="card-text">This is the second Christopher Nolan movie I have in my list. This movie tells the story of Dom Cobb, who is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Gonna be some bold claims coming up, but not only is this the best Pixar movie but it's the best animated film of all time in my humble opinion. This is the story of Remy who dreams of becoming a great chef, he has great taste for food, but there's only problem, he's a rat. He moves to Paris to follow his dream, and with the help of hapless garbage boy Linguini he puts his culinary skills to the test in the kitchen but he has to stay in hiding at the same time, with hilarious consequences. </p>

      <p class="card-text"> Alex Honnold is the star of this amazing documentary. You're along for the ride with Alex as he attempts to do what I think is the greatest athletic achievement ever by a human being. He is attempting to free solo the famed El Capitan's 900-metre vertical rock face at Yosemite National Park. To free solo something is to climb without the use of any ropes or other protective equipment, using only their climbing shoes and their climbing chalk. Now as you can imagine, this is literally insane, one wrong move and you're dead. This documentary gives you insight on who Alex is and why he wanted to do this, be ready because your palms will be sweaty the entire time watching! </p>

      <br>
      <p class="card-text"> Another great rock-climbing documentary which I highly recommend. This tells the story of Tommy Caldwell and his pursuit of climbing the Dawn Wall, a previously thought to be impossible climb. You go along with him and his climbing partner Kevin Jorgeson on their 6-year long journey as they try and conquer this feat. This was a very intimate film, about the trials and tribulations of two men trying to accomplish one singualar goal. Very beautiful movie and great storytelling.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="card-text"> As a big sushi lover, I was captivated by the premise of this film, I went into it blind and I was left speechless when I finished. On the surface level, it's a movie about a dad and his son and their day to day lives running a 3 Star Michelin resturant, but it's so much more than that. As you watch you begin understand how much work and preparation goes into running a top-tier sushi resturant. You dive into the lives of father and son and struggles they go through as he faced with the task of one day having to take over the resturant. Filled with beautiful cinematograpy throughtout the whole and it has a matching soundtrack to boot. </p>

      <p class="card-text"> One of my favorite rom coms of all time. The movie is about Cal Weaver who is living the American dream. He has a good job, a beautiful house, great children and a beautiful wife, named Emily. Cal's seemingly perfect life unravels, however, when he learns that Emily has been unfaithful and wants a divorce. Over 40 and suddenly single, Cal is adrift in the fickle world of dating. Now enter, Jacob Palmer, a self-styled player who takes Cal under his wing and teaches him how to be a hit with the ladies. Most rom coms are fairly predicatable and you usually have a sense of what's going to happen, but this one was different.</p>
